# My implementation of UNIX shell

## Build
For \*nix systems
```
make
```
Then run
```
./bin/mysh
```

## What I have implemented:
1. Execution of commands
2. Builtin commands (cd, exit, exec)
3. List of commands (&&, ||, ;)
4. Subshells
5. Line continuation (partially)
6. Redirects and pipes
7. Command substitutions 

## What I plan to implement:
1. Commands history
2. Env variables
